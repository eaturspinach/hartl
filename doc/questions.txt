1) is the email regex good enough?  can't you have numbers in an email
addy?
2) i found that self.encrypted_password = encrypt(self.password) more
explicit and clear than self.encrypted_password = encrypt(password)
3) remember what "secure one-way hashing" is
4) why use User.new instead of User.create! in specs?
